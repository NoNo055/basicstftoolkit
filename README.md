## What this is (and what it’s not)

CTF.sh is a no-nonsense toolkit built for seasoned operators, penetration testers, and CTF veterans.  
If you seek hand-holding or GUI wizards, turn back now. This is raw, terminal-driven power — made to be wielded by those who understand the battlefield.

Script kiddies and amateurs, save your time bit**.


---

## Requirements

- You must know your way around the Linux terminal  
- python3, pip3, nmap, dirb, gobuster, and basic package management  
- No GUI, no hand-holding 

---

## How to deploy

Clone the repository  
Install dependencies as per your environment  
Run the script  
Select your operation and provide targets manually. No babysitting here.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Module errors? Fix your environment.  
- Naming conflicts? Do not name scripts whois.py or openvpn.py  
- Need to update? Use the update option in the menu. Do not waste time.
